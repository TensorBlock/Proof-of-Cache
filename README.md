# Proof of Cache
**Proof of Cache (PoC)** is an **Efficient Verification Protocol** for Decentralized Inference in Large Language Models (LLMs).

Decentralized inference networks for LLMs enable the deployment of complex models across multiple machines, facilitating collaborative inference. However, ensuring computational integrity in these architectures remains challenging. Existing methods, such as redundant computation, are inefficient and costly. In this work, we introduce a novel **KV-cache sampling** approach, leveraging the deterministic internal states of LLMs to enable lightweight and efficient verification. By reducing computational redundancy and maximizing hardware parallelism, this approach significantly enhances verification efficiency. Additionally, we propose a protocol design for the verification process that ensures fairness among participants and long-term system sustainability. Finally, we discuss payoff distributions and outline potential avenues for optimizing the protocol in future work.
